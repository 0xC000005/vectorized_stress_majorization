## Note
Due to the complexity of our user interactive system, the interaction part is not included in our distribution. The UI system is provided as an executable file(.exe) for Windows operating system.

These codes include the main contribution of our algorithm, Vector Stress Majorization. We provide two sample codes for you to test. You can modify it based on them to fit your need.

Note that the edges, distances matrix, circles, and communities are read from files. We do not provide the algorithms for calculating distances or finding communities and circles. And the format of data should be organized as the sample datasets we provide.

We modified viennaCL to enhance the performance for our need particularly.

## Dependencies
Our system is running under Cuda 8.0, viennaCL, Eigen, and Glut in visual studio 2013. If you want to change the configuration of our solution file, you can modify .... and reload the solution file in visual studio.

## Cite
You can use our codes for research purpose only. And please cite our paper when you use our codes.
